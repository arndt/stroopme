# StroopMe

A project that uses the Stroop effect as the basis for a small training game. The game serves to measure focus and attention on the challenges of mental processing conflicts. 

## Background

The project serves me as a real example to improve my own handling of development and code and to better understand real project problems and challenges in development.
